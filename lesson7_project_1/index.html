                            By definition, according to the Mayo Clinic, "obesity occurs when a person's body mass index is 30 or greater. The excessive body fat increases the risk of serious health problems". Today, children spend a lot time being inactive. For example, the average child spends approximately four hours each day watching television ("Preventing Obesity").</em> This is a concerning statistic because it is unhealthy to spend so much time not doing any physical activity. It is important to stay healthy by being active. Part of the problem with today's society as a whole, is the trend of "couch potatoes". Couch potatoes are a nickname for people who spend majority of their leisure time sitting on a couch. Research continuously shows diet and activity level play a significant role in weight. Unhealthy weight gain due to poor diet and lack of exercise is responsible for over 300,000 deaths each year ("Obesity in Children").

                            While there are some medical conditions that cause weight gain, leading sedentary lives and eating junk food are the to top causes for obesity. "Sitting and watching these commercials promotes snacking, and snacking promotes obesity" ("Childhood Obesity: Causes and Prevention"). Instead of generally being couch potatoes, children should be more encouraged to join sports and go for runs or play outside rather than spending so much time watching television. For an adult, it is reccomended that you get at least one hour of moderate to rigorous physical activity per day to remain healthy.

                            Obesity is more than just a cosmetic matter. Aside from appearance, the deeper problem is the health risks. The risk of major lifelong implications is the main issue with this condition. Today, nearly 70% of Americans are overweight or obese. As obesity is a growing problem, it needs to also be a growing concern. The future of the country is in danger. Obesity threatens to shorten the lifespan of Americans. Imagine a world in ten years. What will everyone look like? It is devastating that with the way things are going today, the average person will be obese.

                            In order to effectively prevent and efficiently stop the rise of this condition, <em>it is important to come up with a way to change how people are living</em>. Many scientists are concerned that our generation may be the first generation to not outlive our parents' ages. A report published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine suggests that, <q>"by 2030 as much as 42 percent of the country will be obese"</q>. Obesity increases the risk for certain cancers, including the breast, colon, rectum and pancreas, and also increases makes one more likely to develop heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, among other chronic conditions. According to the National Cancer Institute, "approximately 34,000 new cases of cancer were related to obesity in 2007" ("Is Cheap Food to Blame‚Äù). More than one-quarter of health care costs are now related to obesity ("Obesity"). Obesity happens one pound at a time- so does prevention.
